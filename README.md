# Hearth Frontend Engineer Take Home Challenge

Hello and welcome, I took this opportunity to really dive deep into Next.JS App Router, it's surrounding patterns. I must say, huge fan!

## Overview

The **Contact Table Application** is a responsive web app designed to showcase a contact table with detailed views of individual contacts. This app leverages the powerful features of Next.js 13 and Tailwind CSS to provide a seamless, performant, and visually appealing user experience. The contact details include a "temperature" indicator, displaying a percentage score and a colorful blurred background that changes dynamically based on the score.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Contact Table**: Displays all contacts from mock data.
- **ContactDetailCard**: Shows all available information for a selected contact in a popup/modal with a colorful background.
- **Temperature Indicator**: Highlights a contact's temperature score visually with an animated number and background color.
- **Animations**: Provides a smooth fade-in effect for the main content.
- **Reusability**: Modular components like `TemperatureDisplay` can be easily reused or extended.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 13**: Advanced web framework using App Router.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern utility-first CSS framework.
- **TypeScript**: Strictly typed JavaScript for more reliable and maintainable code.
- **SCSS**: Custom styles combined with Tailwind utilities.
- **React-Spring**: Really cool Animation Library for naturally fluid animations.
- **Jest**: Unit tests written with Jest/ RTL
