# Hearth Frontend Engineer Take Home Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to my submission for the Hearth Frontend Engineer Take Home Challenge. This project was an excellent opportunity to deeply explore Next.js's App Router and its associated patterns. I must say, huge fan! When combined with the aesthetics and utility of Tailwind CSS and React-Spring, this project showcases a solution that beautifully balances functionality with design elegance.

You can view a detailed walkthrough of my project and its features in my [Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/f42bbf60c2e44108a62a62ce72878ca5?sid=7fd02d9e-570b-450c-bd93-6169e8d5d03e).

## Project Overview

This responsive web application features a dynamic contact table with detailed views of individual contacts. It demonstrates effective use of Next.js's cutting-edge technology and design patterns to deliver a seamless, intuitive user experience. Particular attention has been paid to the visual representation of data, especially through a "temperature" indicator that dynamically visualizes data vibrancy and relevance. The ContactTable component includes pagination and sorting functionality, ensuring smooth UX for large data sets across devices and handling edge cases for data integrity.

### Key Features

- **Next.JS App Router**: Leveraged this cutting-edge technology for rapid SSR, utilizing parallel routing with streamlined loading states and error handling. Deeply impressed by its efficiency.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive design ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Contact Table**: Interactive table displaying a list of contacts with options to view detailed information.
- **Detailed Contact View**: Modal presentation of contact details with a dynamic temperature indicator, reflecting the engagement level through color-coded backgrounds.
- **Animated Interactions**: Utilizes React Spring for smooth, physics-based animations to enhance UI interactivity.
- **Reusable Components and Hooks**: Designed for scalability and reuse, components like `TemperatureDisplay` are modular and can be integrated into other projects with minimal adjustments.
- **Enhanced Accessibility Features**: Implemented focus trapping within modals and keyboard navigation across interactive elements, ensuring the application is accessible to users with disabilities and supports various assistive technologies.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 13**: Utilizing the latest features of Next.js for server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Implementing a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and improving the maintainability of the codebase.
- **SCSS**: Enhancing CSS with the power of Sass for more complex styling solutions.
- **React Spring**: Adding organic animations that respond to user interactions.
- **Jest and React Testing Library**: Conducting unit and integration tests to ensure component reliability.
